4.a) 
Image with erosion
- erosion.pgm
time-step=0.5, iter=1

The dilatated image on resultant erosion image 
- erosion_dilation.pgm
time-step=0.5, iter=1

Normalized final image
- erosion_dilation_norm.pgm
time-step=0.5, iter=1

4.b)
eg:
- head_diff_0.1_2.pgm
Erosion: time-step=0.1, iter=2
Dilation: time-step=0.1, iter=2

- head_diff.pgm
Erosion: time-step=0.5, iter=1
Dilation: time-step=0.5, iter=1

- head_diff_0.2_20.pgm
Erosion: time-step=0.2, iter=20
Dilation: time-step=0.2, iter=20
